todo (recent at top):

LOG FRAME IDEAS:

choose a day, or past 7 days, or past 30 days
view all of a task (sorted by date)



Style all widgets
figure out how to display saved times

TODO AS OF 8-22-20:
BUG with how current time is grabbed. Not sure why. Example: 19:09 is saved as 19:9, 19:00 is saved as 19:0


UH OOH BIG BOO BOO IN TASKS.PY -> WHEN NO TASKS IN DB THERE IS AN ERROR


DATABASE FUNCTIONALITY
- Create session class
- Specify current activity/task
- Create the data access object (writes to and reads from database)




ACTIVITIES
- Dropdown menu for selecting current activity
- Activities frame for adding/deleting activities











- Test to make sure usersettings.ini is generated with a new download

- Design color schemes for whole application?

- Figure out how to make distributable .exe

!!! weird bug where sometimes the program doesn't really shut down all the way; cmd doesn't open up (this started after messing with configparser and settings being saved) !!!
above bug can be triggered by: -> change FG, change BG, open timer, close app (not 100% of the time??)
seems to happen on the first run of things???




- QUESTION: Should clocks continue running when user goes back to main menu?? They currently do. 



- change settings button to have a cog instead of saying settings

- spacing for the buttons (the way the text changes shift the sizes and shit)



- ?bind enter key to start

- validation in settings to make sure the time is less than an hour

- continue looking for bugs in all three timers

- start on hooking up the database to the program


- make fancy charts and stuff ??





- research if tkinter can have cool animations for timers instead of a basic digital clock

- create folder for sound effects
- download multiple sound effects to have options in settings


ideas:

make todo app, connect to timer.
