todo:

spacing for the buttons (the way the text changes shift the sizes and shit)



?bind enter key to start

validation in settings to make sure the time is less than an hour

continue looking for bugs in all three timers

start on hooking up the database to the program


make fancy charts and stuff ??

create settings button and GUI

settings for timer color scheme???

research if tkinter can have cool animations for timers instead of a basic digital clock

ideas:

make todo app, connect to timer.
