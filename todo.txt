todo (recent at top):

(added 8-31)DISPLAY DATA: 
- Show totals of each task at top/bottom
- Maybe have a button to click to display the list of every session
	but otherwise just display the totals?

LOG FRAME IDEAS:

figure out calendar objects

choose a day, or past 7 days, or past 30 days
view all of a task (sorted by date)



Style all widgets
figure out how to display saved times

TODO AS OF 8-22-20:



UH OOH BIG BOO BOO IN TASKS.PY -> WHEN NO TASKS IN DB THERE IS AN ERROR


DATABASE FUNCTIONALITY
- Create session class
- Specify current activity/task
- Create the data access object (writes to and reads from database)


- Figure out more advanced color schemes

- Figure out how to make distributable .exe

!!! weird bug where sometimes the program doesn't really shut down all the way; cmd doesn't open up (this started after messing with configparser and settings being saved) !!!
above bug can be triggered by: -> change FG, change BG, open timer, close app (not 100% of the time??)
seems to happen on the first run of things???




- change settings button to have a cog instead of saying settings

- spacing for the buttons (the way the text changes shift the sizes and shit)

- bind enter key to add task

- continue looking for bugs in all three timers

- start on hooking up the database to the program

- make fancy charts and stuff ??
rs




- research if tkinter can have cool animations for timers instead of a basic digital clock

- create folder for sound effects
- download multiple sound effects to have options in settings

ToDo for DISPLAYDATA:

- figure out how resize when fullscreen
- column headers for data
- make the displayed data fit
- make spreadsheet-style grid for displaying the data.


ideas:

make todo app, connect to timer.
