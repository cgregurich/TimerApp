todo (recent at top):

- Design color schemes for whole application?

- Figure out how to make distributable .exe

!!! weird bug where sometimes the program doesn't really shut down all the way; cmd doesn't open up (this started after messing with configparser and settings being saved) !!!




- QUESTION: Should clocks continue running when user goes back to main menu?? They currently do. 


- add pomo settings to settings menu

- change settings button to have a cog instead of saying settings

- spacing for the buttons (the way the text changes shift the sizes and shit)



- ?bind enter key to start

- validation in settings to make sure the time is less than an hour

- continue looking for bugs in all three timers

- start on hooking up the database to the program


- make fancy charts and stuff ??





- research if tkinter can have cool animations for timers instead of a basic digital clock

- create folder for sound effects
- download multiple sound effects to have options in settings


ideas:

make todo app, connect to timer.
