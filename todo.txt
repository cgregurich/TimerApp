todo (recent at top):

- Calendar showing streaks for goals. Simple green dot or some shish

-Setting for how to calculate a week in ViewLog. Two options: 7 day week, where end date will be today and the start date will be 7 days ago. Or the sunday to sunday option where the start date will be the most recent sunday the end day will be today


- FIND OUT HOW TO MAKE THE PROGRAM BE A LITTLE BUTTHOLE IF I'm TRYING TO SHUT OFF THE COMPUTER WHILE THE PROGRAM IS RUNNING/A TIMER IS RUNNING??




COMPLETED 1-16-21
** - Add setting/change functionality -> log sessions based on when timer started??
BUG: CAN'T SELECT UNTRACKED TASK?????
resizing works except the un-resizable is only triggered when you hit the back button on the ViewLog window.

- if working on an untracked, don't ask to log it??
- BUG: Double error popup when time entered in Timer is invalid (such as letters)
- Add a start and end date selection in ViewLog when searching by task
- Refactor functions that have to do with resetting the timer/pomo so it's more readable; clear commented code


# TODO FOR THE NEXT TIME I WORK ON THIS:

- Make it so all 3 .db files and usersettings.ini is in some folder. eg. userfiles
-*** Get rid of windows dialog sound when notifying that untracked is done
- Clear this mess of a todo.txt!
-*** Maybe make a stopwatch + pomo/timer combo? So I can know when I've done X amount of time, but if I want to finish something I'm working on, I don't have to stop what I'm doing, focus the timer, log the session, then set a stopwatch. What a hassle!




# TODO:
# WHERE I LEFT OFF: 
# I released it and have the goals on my local version
# but I need to figure out how to make resizing not be such
# a bitch. If I manually resize at any time, then the program
# seems to lose its ability to figure out the appropriate size
# This is okay for most of the program, as most windows shouldn't
# be resizable, but I need ViewLog to be resizable!!

WHERE I LEFT OFF:
just got add goals to properly work, got goals page to be the right size
Need to maybe do some more testing with goals and add goals?? maybe add some padding to most if not all frames?
I feel like I'm forgetting something
clear print statements
check todos written at top of files
release and start using???

FOR THE GOALS:
- create the goals page
- add goals button to main menu
- add goals to TimerApp's frames
- do some testing
- Release


ADD GOALS TO THE TIMER APP:
- Set a daily goal? x hours every day
- Add/delete/edit goals?
- View current progress of goals (time completed, time to go, etc.)
- View streaks? How many days have I hit my goal?
- Calculate how many hours or w/e will be done if I stick to this goal for x days



not sutre what makes this ype of color good? sat? no idea
orange ellow: FFF29C
yellow: FEFF9C
green: #ACFF9C


BUG: when you're in the timer entry (or any entry) and go to a different frame and type
that keyboard input is sent to the last active entry



- make scrollbar work when necessary, not work when not

- change fonts for entries

- organize/rearrange all clocks

- line up settings rows better

BUG: Should probably fix how shit the scrollbar is; scrolls when youre not in the log; scrolls when there's not enough data being displayed
	to warrant a scrollable frame







HAVENT PUSHED:
where i left off: making week and month display in displaydata work. Right now month doesn't display anything; bug with session dao ????
because week DOES work



(added 8-31)DISPLAY DATA: 
- Show totals of each task at top/bottom
- Maybe have a button to click to display the list of every session
	but otherwise just display the totals?

LOG FRAME IDEAS:

figure out calendar objects

choose a day, or past 7 days, or past 30 days
view all of a task (sorted by date)



Style all widgets
figure out how to display saved times

TODO AS OF 8-22-20:



UH OOH BIG BOO BOO IN TASKS.PY -> WHEN NO TASKS IN DB THERE IS AN ERROR


DATABASE FUNCTIONALITY
- Create session class
- Specify current activity/task
- Create the data access object (writes to and reads from database)


- Figure out more advanced color schemes

- Figure out how to make distributable .exe

!!! weird bug where sometimes the program doesn't really shut down all the way; cmd doesn't open up (this started after messing with configparser and settings being saved) !!!
above bug can be triggered by: -> change FG, change BG, open timer, close app (not 100% of the time??)
seems to happen on the first run of things???




- change settings button to have a cog instead of saying settings

- spacing for the buttons (the way the text changes shift the sizes and shit)

- bind enter key to add task

- continue looking for bugs in all three timers

- start on hooking up the database to the program

- make fancy charts and stuff ??
rs




- research if tkinter can have cool animations for timers instead of a basic digital clock

- create folder for sound effects
- download multiple sound effects to have options in settings

ToDo for DISPLAYDATA:

- figure out how resize when fullscreen
- column headers for data
- make the displayed data fit
- make spreadsheet-style grid for displaying the data.


ideas:

make todo app, connect to timer.
