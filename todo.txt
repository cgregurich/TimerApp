todo (recent at top):

****Get a border around data in View Log!!!*********

WHERE I LEFT OFF:
idk i got a lot of stuff done and didn't feel like I ended in the middle of anything. obv need to figure out proper frames 
and not allowing resizing or something?? make log scrollbar not buggy and gay
change fonts for entries
organize entries, eg. in timer
organize shit in settings menu
change button sizes (eg. on/off in settings; back buttons)
make clocks bigger in all sections
make total section of log not such a cesspool
DESIGN ISSUE TO PONDER: the autocomplete search box only searches current tasks; delete tasks won't show up even though they still exist
	within the log

remove all yer fackin print statements ya twat

BUG: Double error message when timer input is invalid
BUG: when auto save is off, when the timer (and maybe pomo) ends, there is still 1 second on the clock when the prompt shows up
BUG: Should probably fix how shit the scrollbar is; scrolls when youre not in the log; scrolls when there's not enough data being displayed
	to warrant a scrollable frame

organize stored settings module; I have both user-editable settings and "under the hood settings"; separate them and comment 


THERES SOME GOOD IDEAS HERE BOI I TELL U HWHATs
finish implementing booter widgets
change size of timer control buttons and back buttons??
make buttons correct when hovering, clicking
figure out dynamic resizing
maybe change how buttons look when you click them? not too bad right now but something to consider
make settings a cog instead a huge settings buttons
in pomo, make button be "skip break" instead of "change pomo mode"???
format the timers so the timer is kind of in its own space, not scrunched next to buttons
reference reddit post and make .exe not super slow




HAVENT PUSHED:
where i left off: making week and month display in displaydata work. Right now month doesn't display anything; bug with session dao ????
because week DOES work



(added 8-31)DISPLAY DATA: 
- Show totals of each task at top/bottom
- Maybe have a button to click to display the list of every session
	but otherwise just display the totals?

LOG FRAME IDEAS:

figure out calendar objects

choose a day, or past 7 days, or past 30 days
view all of a task (sorted by date)



Style all widgets
figure out how to display saved times

TODO AS OF 8-22-20:



UH OOH BIG BOO BOO IN TASKS.PY -> WHEN NO TASKS IN DB THERE IS AN ERROR


DATABASE FUNCTIONALITY
- Create session class
- Specify current activity/task
- Create the data access object (writes to and reads from database)


- Figure out more advanced color schemes

- Figure out how to make distributable .exe

!!! weird bug where sometimes the program doesn't really shut down all the way; cmd doesn't open up (this started after messing with configparser and settings being saved) !!!
above bug can be triggered by: -> change FG, change BG, open timer, close app (not 100% of the time??)
seems to happen on the first run of things???




- change settings button to have a cog instead of saying settings

- spacing for the buttons (the way the text changes shift the sizes and shit)

- bind enter key to add task

- continue looking for bugs in all three timers

- start on hooking up the database to the program

- make fancy charts and stuff ??
rs




- research if tkinter can have cool animations for timers instead of a basic digital clock

- create folder for sound effects
- download multiple sound effects to have options in settings

ToDo for DISPLAYDATA:

- figure out how resize when fullscreen
- column headers for data
- make the displayed data fit
- make spreadsheet-style grid for displaying the data.


ideas:

make todo app, connect to timer.
