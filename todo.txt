todo (recent at top):

TEXT OF TOTALS SECTION TIME IS WRONG; WRONG FONT/SIZE

Change icon size. Seems sort of small??

not sure what makes this type of color good? sat? no idea
orange ellow: FFF29C
yellow: FEFF9C
green: #ACFF9C

****Get a border around data in View Log!!!*********

BUG: when you're in the timer entry (or any entry) and go to a different frame and type
that keyboard input is sent to the last active entry

- Add hover color to settings???

- Validation in Settings for time entered

** -Change pomo break noise back to ding

- Make "skip break" in pomo clickable when timer isn't running??

- Add ALL option to view log

- figure out proper frames -- includes all organization of program, shifting widgets

- properly sized buttons

- make scrollbar work when necessary, not work when not

- change fonts for entries

- organize/rearrange all clocks

- line up settings rows better

- enlarge clocks

- clean up total section in log

- remove print statements

- dynamic resizing

- maybe make settings a cog instead of a normal button with text

- change how buttons look when clicked (not necessary!)

- change pomo change pomo mode text/functionality (only skip break)

- organize stored settings module 

BUG: Double error message when timer input is invalid
BUG: when auto save is off, when the timer (and maybe pomo) ends, there is still 1 second on the clock when the prompt shows up
BUG: Should probably fix how shit the scrollbar is; scrolls when youre not in the log; scrolls when there's not enough data being displayed
	to warrant a scrollable frame

$$$$ make a quality executable


DESIGN ISSUE TO PONDER: the autocomplete search box only searches current tasks; delete tasks won't show up even though they still exist
	within the log






HAVENT PUSHED:
where i left off: making week and month display in displaydata work. Right now month doesn't display anything; bug with session dao ????
because week DOES work



(added 8-31)DISPLAY DATA: 
- Show totals of each task at top/bottom
- Maybe have a button to click to display the list of every session
	but otherwise just display the totals?

LOG FRAME IDEAS:

figure out calendar objects

choose a day, or past 7 days, or past 30 days
view all of a task (sorted by date)



Style all widgets
figure out how to display saved times

TODO AS OF 8-22-20:



UH OOH BIG BOO BOO IN TASKS.PY -> WHEN NO TASKS IN DB THERE IS AN ERROR


DATABASE FUNCTIONALITY
- Create session class
- Specify current activity/task
- Create the data access object (writes to and reads from database)


- Figure out more advanced color schemes

- Figure out how to make distributable .exe

!!! weird bug where sometimes the program doesn't really shut down all the way; cmd doesn't open up (this started after messing with configparser and settings being saved) !!!
above bug can be triggered by: -> change FG, change BG, open timer, close app (not 100% of the time??)
seems to happen on the first run of things???




- change settings button to have a cog instead of saying settings

- spacing for the buttons (the way the text changes shift the sizes and shit)

- bind enter key to add task

- continue looking for bugs in all three timers

- start on hooking up the database to the program

- make fancy charts and stuff ??
rs




- research if tkinter can have cool animations for timers instead of a basic digital clock

- create folder for sound effects
- download multiple sound effects to have options in settings

ToDo for DISPLAYDATA:

- figure out how resize when fullscreen
- column headers for data
- make the displayed data fit
- make spreadsheet-style grid for displaying the data.


ideas:

make todo app, connect to timer.
