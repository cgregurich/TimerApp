!!!!!! FIX BUG IN STOPWATCH WHERE SIXTY MINUTES DOESN'T ROLL OVER CORRECTLY !!!! (use sped up time to debug) -> i believe 61 minutes displays as 01:61:00

!!!! RESET METHODS SHOULD ALSO CLEAR THE SCREEN INSTEAD OF JUST DRAWING OVER THE CURRENT SCREEN !!!!

- save settings (not sure how; database? .ini?)

- add pomo settings to settings menu

- change settings button to have a cog instead of saying settings

- spacing for the buttons (the way the text changes shift the sizes and shit)



- ?bind enter key to start

- validation in settings to make sure the time is less than an hour

- continue looking for bugs in all three timers

- start on hooking up the database to the program


- make fancy charts and stuff ??





- research if tkinter can have cool animations for timers instead of a basic digital clock

- create folder for sound effects
- download multiple sound effects to have options in settings


ideas:

make todo app, connect to timer.
