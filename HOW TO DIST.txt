Writing this down so I don't forget.

How to create an .exe

Command to run for pyinstaller: 
pyinstaller --icon "resources/images/icon.ico" -w --add-data "resources;resources" --hidden-import "babel.numbers" timerapp.py

What does this mean?
pyinstaller: use pyinstaller, the tool for packacking the program
-F: synonymous with --onefile; makes a single .exe
-w: Makes it so the CMD doesn't pop up when the program is ran
--icon "icon.ico": Uses the file icon.ico as the icon for the program
--hidden-import "babel.numbers": Because I don't know how to create a hook file; pyinstaller has an 
	issue trying to resolve this import (it's used in tkcalendar), so this is a fix
timerapp.py: which python file to package up


Then zip up the whole mamma jamma (the dist folder)

Could even use NSIS
